- 👋 Hi, I’m @harshittaaa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things everyday and make everyday insightful by working with tech savy people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manage my tasks properly by alloting time to different pieces of work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects or a startup because I love working with startups and I have already worked with many startups on different tech stack such as Angular, React, Firebase, TypeScript(it's awesome). I believe the thrill in work stays when you collaborate with others and work as a team.
